# Freeflow_Arcade_Unblocked_HTML_Games
This is a fully  HTML only unblocked games website. There are 2 files both are working. The single html file is my main link with 2000+ games the other zip file is a work in progress with only the most requested games. 

Here are the instructions on how to deploy, your options are CodeHS, Netlify, Or any other platform that supports these file types really. For CodeHS simply create a account and make new html5 project then press new in the top left corner and upload your which ever game website you want to create. Then hit save and open the link. For Netlify use there drag and drop website creater and just select the file you want. I hope this helps! Please note the proxy doesnt work unless you use the offical Freeflow Arcade URL.
